            <h2 class="white-text">What We Do</h2>
            <p class="white-text">Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered all over this
            planet; you just need to know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base
            Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over
            them. We’re proud of our record of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers
            make it to the top of Kili, depending on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides
            that make the journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re not into big
            climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks and iconic treks you’ll
            love, too.

                <p>She has booked two major European trips for us in the past year and every aspect
                    has met, and in most cases exceeded, our expectations. Best prices, best hotels,
                    best itineraries, and best cruises, she does it all. But the most important thing is she
                    remembers the little things that we would do if we were making the plans ourselves.</p>

                <p>Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20 years and
                    there is no one else I would trust to arrange my trips and tours. I've also had great
                    fun on a few of the group trips she has arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a
                    10-day cruise out of Venice and diving. It's always an eclectic group of well traveled,
                    interesting people.</p>
